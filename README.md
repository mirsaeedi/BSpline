# Spline Curve Fitting

This project provide you with several curve fitting methods. Moreover, for each method you can visually observe the error. The implemented curve fitting methods are as follows.

1. **B-Spline**
2. **Bezier**
3. **Linear Reciprocal**
4. **Non-Linear Reciprocal**
5. **Non-Linear Exponential**
6. **Non-Linear Gaussian**
7. **Non-Linear SQRT**
8. **Chebyshev Polynomials First Kind**
9. **Chebyshev Polynomials Second Kind**
10. **Bessel Polynomials**
11. **Legendre Polynomials**
12. **Laguerre Polynomials**
13. **Monomial Polynomials**
14. **Piecewise Approximation**

Each of the methods support specific parameters for _Approximation_ and _Interpolation_ which give you a flexibility in shaping the curve you desire. For example, for _B-Spline_ you can select from several _knot_ and _Parameter_ selection algorithms and you are free to choose the number of _control points_.

:cupid: For implementing [_B-Spline](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/spline-curve-fitting/tree/master/wwwroot/js/BSpline)_ and [_Bezier_](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/spline-curve-fitting/tree/master/wwwroot/js/Bezier) curves, I exactly followed _Dr. Shene_ [notes](https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/) which seems to be the best available resource on this matter.


# Usage

You just need to [download](https://github.com/mirsaeedi/spline-curve-fitting/archive/master.zip) the project and then open the _index.hmlt_ page using a modern Web Browser such as Google Chrome.
